<h2>Everybody has to start somewhere!  Completed coursework from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.</h2>
<p>
The files within this repository were downloaded from freeCodeCamp after I completed each lesson.  They can be used as review if a certain
concept has been forgotten or if a sample of code is needed to refresh my memory.
<br>
It doesn't hurt that it's a reminder of how far I've come every time I see the completed lessons.
<br>
If it can help you, by all means use it!
<br>
Enjoy, and happy coding!
